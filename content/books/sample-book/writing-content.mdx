## Writing for a Digital Garden

Writing for a digital garden is different from writing a blog post or an academic paper. Here are some principles to keep in mind.

### Embrace Imperfection

Not every note needs to be polished. Use status indicators to signal maturity:

- **Seedling** — Just an idea, rough and unformed
- **Budding** — Developing, has some structure
- **Evergreen** — Mature, well-developed content

### Link Generously

The power of a digital garden comes from connections. Link to related notes whenever you mention a concept that has its own page.

## Organizing Your Notes

### By Topic, Not by Date

Group your content by subject matter. Use tags and categories to create multiple ways to discover related content.

### Use Series for Sequential Content

When content needs to be read in order, create a series. Series provide:

- A clear reading path
- Progress tracking
- Navigation between parts

### Use Books for Structured Knowledge

For comprehensive, structured content, use the book format:

- Chapters organized into parts
- A persistent sidebar for navigation
- A clear beginning, middle, and end

## Practical Tips

1. **Write regularly** — even short notes compound over time
2. **Revisit old notes** — update and expand them as your understanding grows
3. **Cross-pollinate** — connect ideas from different domains
4. **Share early** — others can benefit from your thinking process
