## Choosing Your Tools

The right toolset depends on your goals, technical comfort, and how you want your garden to grow.

### Static Site Generators

For developers, static site generators offer full control:

- **Next.js** — React-based, great for complex gardens
- **Astro** — Content-focused, supports multiple frameworks
- **Hugo** — Lightning fast, Go-based

### Hosted Platforms

For non-developers, hosted options provide quick setup:

- **Notion** — Flexible databases and easy sharing
- **Obsidian Publish** — From local notes to published garden
- **GitBook** — Documentation-style layout

## Setting Up the Project

Once you've chosen your tools, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize** your project and version control
2. **Configure** your content structure
3. **Design** your navigation and linking strategy
4. **Deploy** to your hosting platform of choice

## Content Organization

A well-organized garden uses a clear folder structure:

```
content/
  posts/          # Individual notes and articles
  series/         # Curated collections
  books/          # Long-form structured content
```

### Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, URL-friendly filenames like `setting-up-your-garden.mdx` rather than dates or numbers. This keeps your URLs meaningful and permanent.
