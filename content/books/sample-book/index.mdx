Welcome to **The Digital Garden Handbook**. This book will guide you through the philosophy, setup, and maintenance of a digital garden — a personal knowledge base that grows organically over time.

Unlike traditional blogs that emphasize chronological posts, digital gardens focus on interconnected ideas that evolve and mature. This handbook covers everything from choosing your tools to cultivating a thriving knowledge ecosystem.
