A digital garden is a different way of thinking about a personal website. Unlike a blog — where posts are dated, finished, and pushed into a feed — a garden is a space of growing, evolving ideas.

## The Garden vs. The Stream

The stream metaphor (Twitter, blogs, newsletters) privileges recency. New things rise, old things sink. The garden metaphor privileges *connection*. Notes link to other notes; ideas accrete over time.

Mike Caulfield's 2015 talk "The Garden and the Stream" is the canonical introduction to this distinction. He argues the stream has colonized how we think about the web, and that the garden offers a richer alternative.

## Epistemic States

In a garden, notes can exist at different stages of development:

- **Seedling** — rough, barely-formed idea
- **Budding** — developing, but incomplete
- **Evergreen** — mature and stable (but still revisable)

Publishing work-in-progress is uncomfortable at first. But it's honest, and it invites readers to engage with thinking rather than just conclusions.

## This Garden

[[welcome-to-amytis|This site's founding post]] describes the original intent. The notes section implements the garden layer on top of the existing blog structure.

The underlying method is [[zettelkasten-method|Zettelkasten]]: atomic notes, linked by meaning rather than filed by category. The result is a network of ideas that can be navigated in any direction — following curiosity rather than chronology.
