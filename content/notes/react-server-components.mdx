React Server Components (RSC) represent the most significant architectural shift in React since hooks. The mental model: components that run only on the server, produce static output, and ship *zero* JavaScript to the client.

## The Key Insight

Before RSC, React components were always client-side primitives — even when rendered on the server via SSR, their JavaScript was re-hydrated in the browser. RSC breaks this assumption. A server component:

- Can directly `await` database queries, file reads, or API calls
- Never re-renders on the client (no hydration cost)
- Can import server-only packages without any client bundle impact

## Composition Model

The power is in the *composition*: you can freely mix server and client components in the same tree. A server component can render a client component; a client component can receive server-rendered children as props.

```tsx
// Server component — runs only on server
async function ArticlePage({ slug }: { slug: string }) {
  const post = await getPostBySlug(slug); // direct DB/file access
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <LikeButton postId={post.id} /> {/* client component */}
      <MarkdownContent content={post.body} /> {/* server component */}
    </article>
  );
}
```

## The "use client" Boundary

`"use client"` marks the boundary where server-rendered output hands off to client-side JavaScript. It doesn't mean "client-only" — server-rendered HTML still crosses the boundary; only interactivity (event handlers, state) requires the client bundle.

Common pitfall: passing non-serializable values (like a `Map` or class instance) through the boundary. These can't be serialized to JSON and will cause a runtime error.

## Relation to Hooks

RSC doesn't replace [[understanding-react-hooks|React hooks]] — hooks remain the right tool for client-side state and effects. The shift is that *data fetching* moves to the server, while *interactivity* stays with hooks on the client.

The practical result: far less `useEffect` for data loading, simpler components, better performance.

## In Next.js App Router

Next.js App Router makes RSC the default. Every component in `app/` is a server component unless it declares `"use client"`. This site's data layer (`src/lib/markdown.ts`) runs exclusively on the server — no API routes needed.
