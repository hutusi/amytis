The Zettelkasten ("slip-box") method is a personal knowledge management system developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. He produced over 90 books and hundreds of articles, crediting much of his productivity to this system.

## Core Principles

**Atomic notes** — each note captures exactly one idea. If you need to say two things, write two notes. This constraint forces clarity and creates more connection points.

**Linking over filing** — instead of organizing notes into folders or categories, you link them to related ideas. The structure that emerges is a network, not a tree.

**Your own words** — always paraphrase rather than copy. The act of rewriting forces understanding and makes the note genuinely yours.

**Permanent notes** — unlike fleeting notes (quick captures) or literature notes (summaries of sources), permanent notes are written to last. They connect to existing knowledge and stand alone without context.

## Why It Works

A folder system forces you to predict how you'll want to retrieve something. Linking lets you discover connections you didn't anticipate. Luhmann described his Zettelkasten as a "conversation partner" — it would surprise him with unexpected connections between distant ideas.

The compounding effect is real: the more notes you have, the more connections are possible, and the more generative each new note becomes.

## Relation to Digital Gardens

[[digital-garden-philosophy]] takes the Zettelkasten spirit and applies it to public publishing. Where Luhmann's slip-box was private, a digital garden invites readers into the thinking process — with all its incompleteness and revision.

## In This Garden

This site implements Zettelkasten-style notes with bi-directional links. Any `[[wikilink]]` you write creates a connection that shows up in the backlinks panel of the target note.

See the [[digital-garden-philosophy]] note for how this fits the broader philosophy of this garden.
