# Getting Started

Next.js 15 brings powerful new features to the table. In this part, we explore the foundation: the App Router, Bun as a package manager, and static export for deployment.

## Setting Up with Bun

Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime and package manager that pairs well with Next.js 15. Creating a new project takes a single command:

```bash
bunx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
bun dev
```

Bun's install speed is noticeably faster than npm or yarn, and its built-in bundler means fewer dependencies in your toolchain.

## The App Router

Next.js 15 uses the App Router by default, replacing the legacy Pages Router. The key difference is that **every component is a Server Component** unless you explicitly opt in to client-side rendering with `"use client"`.

```typescript
// app/page.tsx — This is a Server Component by default
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15</h1>
      <p>This component renders on the server.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Server Components unlock several benefits:

- **Smaller client bundles** — Server-only code never ships to the browser
- **Direct data access** — Query databases or read files without an API layer
- **Streaming** — The server can send HTML progressively as components render

## Static Export

For sites that don't need a running server (blogs, documentation, landing pages), Next.js supports full static export:

```typescript
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

Running `bun run build` with this configuration generates a `out/` directory containing plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can deploy this to any static hosting service — GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or an S3 bucket.

## What's Next

In [Part 2](/series/nextjs-deep-dive), we'll explore the file-based routing system in depth: dynamic routes, route groups, layouts, and how Next.js turns your folder structure into a fully-featured application.
