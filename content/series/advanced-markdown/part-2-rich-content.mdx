# Rich Content and Multimedia

Welcome back to the **Advanced Markdown Mastery** series. In this second part, we move beyond text structure to explore how we can present data and visuals effectively.

## 1. Complex Tables

Markdown tables are excellent for structured data. We've ensured that wide tables are scrollable on smaller screens.

| Category | Component | Description | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Logic** | `MarkdownRenderer` | The core engine for parsing and rendering MDX. | High |
| **Nav** | `TableOfContents` | Sticky sidebar providing quick access to headings. | Medium |
| **UI** | `PostCard` | Elegant grid item with hover effects and cover images. | Low |
| **Asset** | `ExportedImage` | Optimized image loader for static site exports. | Medium |

## 2. Mermaid Diagrams

We support Mermaid for generating charts and diagrams from plain text. This is perfect for architectural overviews.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Content Source] --> B{Parser}
    B -- Markdown --> C[ReactMarkdown]
    B -- Metadata --> D[Frontmatter]
    C --> E[Styled components]
    D --> F[Layout logic]
    E --> G[Final Web Page]
    F --> G
```

## 3. Mathematical Notation (LaTeX)

For technical notes, KaTeX support allows us to render formulas like the **Standard Deviation**:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}
$$

Or inline formulas like the Euler's identity: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

## 4. Optimized Images

Images are automatically optimized during the build process. You can use co-located assets or remote URLs.
