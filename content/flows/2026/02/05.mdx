Switched fully to Bun for this project. The speed difference is remarkable — `bun install` finishes before `npm install` even resolves the dependency tree.

The test runner is also surprisingly capable. Compatible with Jest-style APIs but runs significantly faster. Still a few edge cases with certain packages, but for most workflows it just works.
