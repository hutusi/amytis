Spent some time digging into React Server Components today. The mental model shift is significant — components that never ship JavaScript to the client, yet can directly access databases and file systems.

## Key Takeaways

- Server Components are the default in Next.js App Router
- Use `"use client"` only when you need interactivity
- Data fetching becomes much simpler without `useEffect` chains

The composability of mixing server and client components in the same tree is elegant once you get used to it.

Writing up a fuller note on this: [[react-server-components]].
