Upgraded the project to Tailwind CSS v4 today. The new CSS-first configuration approach is a breath of fresh air — no more `tailwind.config.js` for most use cases.

The `@theme` directive for defining design tokens directly in CSS feels much more natural. Performance improvements are noticeable too, especially during development with faster HMR.

More detailed notes captured in [[tailwind-v4]] — particularly the breaking changes around dark mode and `@apply`.
