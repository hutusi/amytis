Tested multimedia embedding in Amytis today. Since `rehype-raw` is enabled, standard HTML `<iframe>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>` tags work directly inside Markdown — no plugins needed.

A few patterns that work well:

- **YouTube / Vimeo** — wrap in a `padding-bottom: 56.25%` container for responsive 16:9
- **Spotify / Apple Podcasts** — fixed height iframes (152px for compact, 352px for full player)
- **HTML5 `<video>`** — fully native, supports `poster`, `loop`, `autoplay muted`
- **HTML5 `<audio>`** — great for podcast episodes or background music samples
- **Twitch** — needs the `parent` query param set to your domain

The `loading="lazy"` attribute is underused — always worth adding to below-the-fold embeds to keep the initial page fast.
