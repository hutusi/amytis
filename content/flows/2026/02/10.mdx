Been thinking about the difference between blogs and digital gardens. Blogs are streams — chronological, finished thoughts published into the void. Gardens are networks — interconnected ideas that grow and evolve over time.

This site tries to bridge both: structured posts for polished essays, and this flow section for raw, daily observations. The garden metaphor resonates because ideas really do need tending.

The [[zettelkasten-method]] is the underlying system that makes a garden actually work — atomic notes linked by meaning rather than filed in folders. And [[digital-garden-philosophy]] explores why publishing half-formed ideas in public is worth the discomfort.
