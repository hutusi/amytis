# Privacy Policy

Your privacy matters. This page explains what data is collected when you visit this site and how it is used.

## Analytics

This site uses **Umami**, a privacy-focused, open-source analytics platform. Umami does not use cookies, does not track users across websites, and does not collect personally identifiable information. The data collected is limited to anonymous page-view statistics such as referrer, browser type, and country — used solely to understand which content is most useful.

No data is sold or shared with third parties.

## Comments

Post comments are powered by **Giscus**, which uses GitHub Discussions. To leave a comment you must sign in with a GitHub account. Your comment and GitHub username are stored by GitHub and are subject to [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

If you do not have a GitHub account or prefer not to use it, you can always reach out directly by email.

## External Links

This site may contain links to external websites. Once you leave this site, the privacy practices of those third-party sites apply and are outside this site's control.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, feel free to reach out at the email address listed in the footer.
