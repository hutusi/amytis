# Hello!

This page demonstrates the **Simple Layout**. It's perfect for pages that are part of your content structure but don't need the heavy metadata header of a blog post.

It still supports all markdown features:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- Code blocks

```javascript
console.log("Simple but powerful");
```
