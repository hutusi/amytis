When designing complex systems, visualization is key. Here is a simple 3-tier architecture example.

## 3-Tier Architecture

This pattern separates the presentation, application processing, and data management functions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client as Web Client
    participant API as API Server
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Client: Enters URL
    Client->>API: Request Data (GET /posts)
    API->>DB: Query Posts
    DB-->>API: Return Records
    API-->>Client: Return JSON
    Client-->>User: Render Page
```

## Microservices Configuration

Often, services communicate via a message bus.

```json
{
  "service": "order-service",
  "dependencies": ["inventory", "payment"],
  "eventBus": "kafka"
}
```
