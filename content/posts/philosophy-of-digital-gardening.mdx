# The Philosophy of Digital Gardening

Unlike a traditional blog, which is a reverse-chronological stream of finished "publications," a **digital garden** is a collection of evolving notes.

## Gardening vs. Architecting

- **Architecting** is about planning everything upfront.
- **Gardening** is about planting seeds and seeing what grows.

### Key Principles

1. **Topography over Chronology:** Organize by topic and connection, not just by date.
2. **Continuous Growth:** Notes are never "finished." They are tended to over time.
3. **Imperfection:** It is okay to share "seedling" thoughts that aren't fully formed.

> "A garden is never finished."

In this garden, you will find a mix of:
- **Seedlings:** Rough notes and initial thoughts.
- **Saplings:** Growing ideas with some structure.
- **Evergreens:** Well-developed concepts.
