# About the Garden

Amytis is a digital garden designed for long-term thought cultivation. Unlike a blog, which is a stream of consciousness, a digital garden is a network of evolving ideas.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15+** for the foundation.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling.
- **MDX** for content rich with React components.
- **Bun** for a lightning-fast development experience.

## The Philosophy

We believe in **Public Learning**. This space is where I plant seeds (initial notes), tend to them (refine and link), and eventually grow them into evergreen articles.

> "A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust." — Gertrude Jekyll
